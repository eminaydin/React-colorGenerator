In this project I've created responsoive simple color generator. I've done this project with Vanilla JS before but I wanted to challenge myself into doing this in React. To generate color wasn't difficult at all but to remove it from DOM was tricky. Then I've came up with an idea to store generated colors in array so that when user wants to remove it I could simply remove the corresponding color from the array. This approach made my task even easier and from there on I haven't encountered with much problems.
